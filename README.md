Sisu is a modular [JSR-330](https://javax-inject.github.io/javax-inject/)-based container that supports classpath scanning, auto-binding, and dynamic auto-wiring.

Sisu uses [Google Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) to perform dependency injection and provide the core JSR-330 support, but removes the need to write explicit bindings in Guice modules. Integration with other containers via the Eclipse Extension Registry and the OSGi Service Registry is a goal of this project.
